# Python3-Chatroom
Small chatroom written in python3 using socks.

A convention is used between the client and server code and hidden from the user. 

The server needs to be run on a host machine, then multiple clients can connect and use this to chat to other clients. 

To use it, open multiple terminals. On the first, run the server.py script and then, on other terminals, run client.py terminals to use the chatroom!

Functions like !who, to see the connected clients, !quit and @message are implemented.
