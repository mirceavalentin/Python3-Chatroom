# Python3-Chatroom
Small chatroom written in python3 using socks.

A convention is used between the client and server code and hidden from the user. 

The server needs to be run on a host machine, then multiple clients can connect and use this to chat to other clients. 

Functions like !who, to see the connected clients, !quit and @message are implemented.
